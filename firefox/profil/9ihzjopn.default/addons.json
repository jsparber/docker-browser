Easy on CPU and memory.","fullDescription":"An efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.\n\nIllustrated overview of its efficiency: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared\n\nUsage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable uBlock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433479123","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Unified logger"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/432957/ublock_origin-1.7.0-sm+tb+fx+an.xpi?src=api","size":1460528,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":486,"totalDownloads":4808625,"weeklyDownloads":180073,"dailyUsers":1021711,"updateDate":1462179339000,"supportURL":"https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/support-ublock-origin/6746"},{"id":"loop@mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"name":"Firefox Hello Beta","type":"extension","version":"1.3.2","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Standard8","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/standard8/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Ian Bicking","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/ianb/?src=api"}],"description":"The latest beta test version of Firefox Hello","fullDescription":"Firefox Hello is looking at addressing user needs via web sharing in Firefox.\n\nThis add-on is the latest version of the current in-development work that is released before the Firefox Hello is updated in Firefox.\n\nInstall it only if you want to help test the newest changes - if you want the stable version, you don't need to do anything - its already in Firefox.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"averageRating":2,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-hello-beta/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/mozilla/loop","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/434841/firefox_hello_beta-1.3.2-fx.xpi?src=api","size":2043360,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-hello-beta/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":4,"totalDownloads":9872,"weeklyDownloads":476,"dailyUsers":9872,"updateDate":1462480940000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/mozilla/loop/blob/master/README.md#issues"}]}
